# Cloud Express Simulator

### Project Overview

**Developers:** Victoire Lebreton, Julien Lelievre, Tristan Querton

This C++/Allegro project explores various aspects of graph theory, focusing on creating a comprehensive air traffic simulation. The goal is to leverage our understanding of graph theory and C++ in this ambitious project.

### Objectives

The simulator is designed to be as realistic as possible, offering two playability modes:

1. **Autopilot Mode:** An automatic version handling take-offs, landings, weather, crashes, etc. You can modify parameters, test changes, and observe the consequences.

2. **Manual Pilot Mode:** Take control of air traffic worldwide. Can you manage the complexities of a vast network of flights?

### Simulation Modes

1. **Normal Map:** Featuring 7 airports across different continents, this mode offers a simplified version of air traffic for familiarization.

2. **Extreme Map:** With 15 airports and heavy air traffic, this mode pushes the simulator's limits, aiming for a more realistic experience.

### How to Run

1. Compile the program using a C++ compiler.
2. Execute the compiled executable to access the simulator.
3. Choose between Autopilot and Manual Pilot modes, and select the simulation map.
