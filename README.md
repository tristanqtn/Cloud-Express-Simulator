# Cloud-Express-Simulator-
C++/Allegro project exploiting different aspects of graph theory

Project by : Victoire LEBRETON - Julien Lelievre - Tristan Querton

 ==

The objective of this project is to bring together our knowledge of graph theory and C++ through a complex project. 
 
 == 

In this project, we create a global air traffic simulator. With many parameters available, the simulator aims to be as realistic as possible. 


 == Playability : 

Autopilot: an automatic version of the simulator that handles all take-offs, landings, weather, crashes, and other problems. The purpose of this mode is to modify some of its parameters and then test and see the consequences of these modifications.

Manual pilot: you become the king/queen of the sky and can control all flights worldwide. Can you manage such a large amount of air traffic? 


 == Simulation mode: 

Normal map: 7 airports around the world allow you to travel across all continents. This simulation offers a simple version of air traffic and allows you to become familiar with the simulator.

Extreme Map: 15 airports and heavy air traffic will allow you to test the limits of the simulator and get as close as possible to reality.
